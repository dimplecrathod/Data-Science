Data Management and Visualization - Wesleyan University 
Week 1

My name is Dimple Rathod, and I’m a third year undergraduate student pursuing IT Engineering. I have a keen interest in the field of Data Science. I have taken up a course Data Management and Visualization by Wesleyan University via coursera.com. 
Each student has to submit their assignments through a blog entry and I have chosen Github to do the same. 
This assignment is a part of part one of the five course Data Management and Visualization by Wesleyan University.

Assignment 1:

Step 1:	Selecting a codebook and a data set: 
After carefully reviewing each codebook and dataset, I choose the Gapminder codebook and its corresponding dataset. This particular dataset includes research based on healthcare and urbanization which intrigues me.

Step 2: Identify a specific topic of interest.
After reviewing various topics and variables in the codebook, the topic that intrigued me is suicide rates and the various factors involved.

Step 3: Prepare a codebook of your own.
The following are the variables that I believe are related to suicide rates. This is presented bellow:

            Variable Name	                                Description of Indicator	 

           	employrate                                    2007 total employees age 15+ (% of population)
                                                          Percentage of total population, age above 15, that has 
                                                          been employed during the given year                                                
            suicideper100TH                               2005 Suicide, age adjusted, per 100 000 
            urbanrate                                     2008 urban population (% of total) 
                                                          Urban population refers to people living in urban areas 
                                                          defined by national statistical offices    



Step 4: Identify a second topic that you would like to explore in terms of its association with your original topic.
After reviewing the GapMinder Codebook and it's corresponding dataset, I saw a possibility of a relationship/association of suicide rates with employment rates and urbanization rates. 

Research Question:
Direct relationship between suicide rate and urbanization rate?
Direct relationship between suicide rate and employment rate?

Step 5: Add questions/items/variables documenting this second topic to your personal codebook.
As mentioned in previous steps, I have created a personal codebook and dataset that includes the above variables mentioned and the data corresponding to the variables. 

Step 6: Literature Review.



[1] Effects of urbanization, economic development, and migration of workers on suicide mortality in Japan:
Authors: Akiko Otsu , Shunichi Araki,Ryoji Sakai, Kazuhito Yokoyama, AScott Voorhees
The relationships between male or female age-adjusted suicide mortality and social life factors for all 47 Japanese prefectures in 1980, 1985 and 1990 were investigated by stepwise multiple regression analysis after classification of 20 social life indicators by factor analysis.
During this period, Japan experienced the second economic crisis (the so-called secondary oil crisis) in 1980–1983 and economic prosperity (bubble economy) in 1986–1990. In all the three years, male suicide mortality was significantly related inversely to the urbanization and economic development factor, the result of which was consistent with the data in our previous study for the years 1970 and 1975. 

[2] Suicide rates in China during a decade of rapid social changes:
Authors :Paul S. F. YipKa Y. LiuJianping HuX. M. Song
A regression model was used to detect any variations in national-, region-, gender-, and age-specific suicide rates and gender ratios reported by the most recent mortality statistics from China's Ministry of Health.
National, urban, and rural suicide rates for both men and women decreased significantly for the period of 1991–2000; age-specific suicide rates, however, showed that there were different patterns of changes in suicide rates in rural and urban areas. Although elderly suicide rates showed the most significant decrease in urban areas, younger women showed the largest decrease in rural areas; male to female gender ratio in suicide increased significantly in the urban areas, but no significant change was found in rural areas.

[3] Low Income, Unemployment, and Suicide Mortality Rates for Middle-Age Persons in Japan :
Authors :Akiko Yamasaki, Ryoji Sakai, Taro Shirakawa
The relationships between age-specific suicide mortality rates and social life factors for all 47 Japanese prefectures in 1980, 1985, and 1990 were assessed by multiple regression analysis after factor analysis on 20 social life indicators
Urbanization was negatively associated with male suicide mortality rates in most of the age classes in the 1980s.
Unemployment was one of the major determinants of increased suicide mortality rate in middle-age men in the 1980s, and unemployment was the major factor which was inversely associated with suicide 

Step 7: Based on your literature review, develop a hypothesis about what you believe the association might be between these topics. Be sure to integrate the specific variables you selected into the hypothesis.
Primary hypothesis:
The suicide rate of a country might be directly related to its urbanization rate.

Secondary hypothesis:
Direct relationship between suicide rates and employment rates.
